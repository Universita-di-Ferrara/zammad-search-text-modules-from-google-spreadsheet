# Zammad search text modules from Google Spreadsheet

A small script to work around the lack of a search tool in Zammad. 

# How does it work?

2. Rename the first tab "get text modules"
3. Select Extensions > App Script
4. Paste the script

A new menu item will be available to search for the group id.
